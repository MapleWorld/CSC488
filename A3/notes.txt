pg 335 - 
"In the design of the visit methods, two goals were paramount. The first was that the operation of each method must be based on only the AST node with which it is associated and information supplied by processing the sub- trees it references, while avoiding any dependency on the structure of any surrounding parts of the AST. The second principle was that checking must produce clear error messages so that a programmer can easily identify the program error that produced any particular message. The notion of using an errorType to deal with type errors was presented. Use of this technique in a consistent way throughout the visit methods is an effective way to minimize the number of error messages generated by the compiler, thus highlighting problems more precisely for the programmer."
