A1c.488 - From assignment 1, a program using all forms of loop building and loop exit constructs.
A1d.488 - From assignment 1, a program using non-recursive functions and procedures with and without parameters.
A1e.488 - From assignment 1, a program using recursive functions and procedures with and without parameters.
